# DataFrameC

Our L1 C Project. The objective is to create a library similar to Panda (of Python) but in C.
Here's a [link to our Github](https://github.com/Fullbust505/CDataFrame).

## Problems

Not all functions return NULL pointers in case of a failure in their execution.

## Last changes

### Linus

All our prior functions work !
We just have to correct the 2 or 3 last ones and then get to the dataframe.

### RaphaÃ«l

All the necessary functions that were asked to be added in the project are present.
We can now start the dataframe part of the project.
