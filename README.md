# DataFrameC

Our L1 C Project. The objective is to create a library similar to Panda (of Python) but in C.
Here's a [link to our Github](https://github.com/Fullbust505/CDataFrame).

Added functions that displays many things from the dataframe :
-the number of rows in the dataframe.
-the number of columns in the dataframe.
-the number of cells in the dataframe that are equal to a given value x.
-the number of cells in the dataframe that contain a value greater than x.
-the number of cells in the dataframe that contain a value less than x.
