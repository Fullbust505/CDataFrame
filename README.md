# DataFrameC

Our L1 C Project. The objective is to create a library similar to Panda (of Python) but in C

## Problems

Not all functions return NULL pointers in case of a failure in their execution.

## Last changes

### Linus

Corrected the "convert_value" function

### RaphaÃ«l

Added a "display_value" and "print_column" function using the "convert_value" to print the value in the needed type
